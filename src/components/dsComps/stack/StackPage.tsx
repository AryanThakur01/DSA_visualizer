This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Imagine a stack of plates in a cafeteria â€“ you add a new plate to the top of the stack, and when you want to take a plate, you take it from the top."

            In a programming context, a stack is often used to manage function
            calls and local variables in a program&apos;s memory. Here are some
            key operations associated with a stack:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc">
            <li>
              <span className="pr-2 font-bold">Push:</span>Adds an item to the
              top of the stack.
            </li>
            <li className="pr-2">
              <span className="font-bold">Pop:</span> Removes the item from the
              top of the stack.
            </li>
            <li className="pr-2">
              <span className="font-bold">Peek or Top:</span> Returns the item
              at the top of the stack without removing it.
            </li>
            <li className="pr-2">
              <span className="font-bold">IsEmpty:</span> Checks if the stack is
              empty.

            In programming languages, a call stack is a specific type of stack
            that is used to keep track of function calls and their local
            variables. When a function is called, a new frame is pushed onto the
            call stack, and when the function completes, its frame is popped off
            the stack.
